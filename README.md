Baby Monitor software
=====================

We're designing a smartphone-compatible baby monitor for the modern caretaker. Using our system, parents and babysitters will be able to securely access a video feed of the child and see graphs of amount of crying, temperature, and humidity over time. This is our Computer Engineering capstone project for EECS 347, Microprocessor System Projects at Northwestern University.
