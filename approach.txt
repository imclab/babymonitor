Options for capturing webcam video in Linux
===========================================

Video4Linux seems to be the way to do it. 
My preferred language is Python and there are several options.

First, we can use some of the direct libraries such as:
- [v4l2 0.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/v4l2)
- [python-video4linux2](https://code.google.com/p/python-video4linux2/)

It's also possible to use V4L2 indirectly through some Python libraries as:
- SimpleCV
- OpenCV
- pygame

To start, I'll use SimpleCV since it seems like the easiest to pick up.
